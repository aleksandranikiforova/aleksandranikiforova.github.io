				<p>
				Approximately, 10 years ago I graduated from the art and music schools. I was not a good student not because I was lazy and did not concentrate on studies. However, probably gained skills develop in me artistic spirit and the desire to create the beauty.

				 Firstly, I started with the drawing. This hobby calm me down and let me relax. Lately, I am not drawing because usually do not have time and inspiration. Sometimes I think that to get the inspiration, I have to undergo some problems to express them in the paper. Sounds weird because I do not want bump with the problems but I want to draw!

				<p>
				I have never thought that I am drawing like a professional. I understand my mistakes; however, I do not have enough skills to correct them. Probably, I had to study in the art school, not just skip classes..! But I am still trying to draw on the faces! :)

				 I want to become a make up artist. I did not take any make up courses; however, I am planning to do that in the future. I want not just work in beauty sphere but to become the one of the best professional.
