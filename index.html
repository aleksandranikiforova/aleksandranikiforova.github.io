				Hello! My name is Aleksandra Nikiforova! I am the student of the LCC International University. I am from the small amount of students who did not come from the other country to study in the LCC University. I am local; however, I am not Lithuanian as you can understand from my surname. I am Russian who born and grew in Lithuania. Actually, I am not true Russian, usually I think in Lithuanian and I have a small amount of Russian friends. That is because in the childhood I visited Lithuanian kindergarden and graduated Lithuanian school and gymansium. I see the huge difference between Russians and Lithuanians. Russians more friendly and opened people than Lithuanians. Probably, if I will graduate Russian gymnasium, I will be a different person... interesting! But I met a really good friends between Lithuanians and try to keep in touch with them periodically!
