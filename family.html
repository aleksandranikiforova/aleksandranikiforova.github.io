				<h2>My Lovely Family</h2>

				The most beloved little person in my family is my brother. His name is John and he is almost 4 years. Most of the people think he is a girl because he is posing when saw somebody is taking photo of him. As you can understand he is the most beloved of all family children because he is the most young of us.

				Yes, in my family are three children and the second one is my sister Vasilisa. She is 14 year old. I can say that she is really responsible person despite her age. This feature of the character makes her smarter than other children in her age. Also, she is a self-collected person. She can concentrate and do a hard tasks. Actually, even I can not sometimes concentrate and do what I need if I have bad mood or feel hungry.
